# TinyM StealthBurner [![Status - Work In Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Work_In_Progress-ffee00)](https://)

![](images/cad_img.png)
This project is based on [Tiny-M](https://github.com/gsl12/Tiny-M "Tiny-M") (190^3 variant) + [Smol StealthBurner](https://github.com/Maverick-3D/Smol_Stealth_Burner "Smol StealthBurner") modified for Phaetus Drgonfly BMO hotend.

The Smol StealthBurner is designed to use a MGN rail in front of X axis, so the following parts have been remixed:

- XY joint  (top and bottom on both sides). The depth has been increased by 6mm (from 40mm to 46mm) to avoid the belt rubs on X axis linear rail. You don't need additional hardware.

- Z axis bed mount (both side). The depth has been increased by 15mm to grant the nozzle reaches all bed edges.

- The StealthBurner cover has been remixed to add a 5050 SMD led like in the original Voron StealthBurner.
